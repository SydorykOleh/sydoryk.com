                    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
                    <p><strong>“Freelancer”</strong> — [Your full legal name / trade name], NIP [xxxxxxxxxx], with registered office at [address], referred to as <strong>“I,” “me,”</strong> or <strong>“my.”</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>“Client”</strong> — the individual or legal entity purchasing services.</p>
                    <p><strong>“Project”</strong> — the scope of work described in a written Proposal, Statement of Work (SOW), quotation, or e-mail confirmed by both parties.</p>
                    <p><strong>“Deliverables”</strong> — all files, documents, designs, code, or other outputs specified in the Project.</p>
                    <p><strong>“Business Day”</strong> — any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday in Poland.</p>

                    <h2>2. Scope &amp; Process</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>2.1 Work starts once the Client accepts the Proposal/SOW in writing (e-mail suffices) and—where required—pays the agreed advance.</li>
                    <li>2.2 The Project includes only the tasks explicitly listed in the Proposal/SOW. Any extra work is a <strong>Change Request</strong> and will be quoted separately.</li>
                    <li>2.3 The Client will supply all content, feedback, and approvals within the timelines we agree; delays may push milestone dates accordingly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>

                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>

                    <p>These Terms, together with the Proposal/SOW and any signed Data Processing Agreement, constitute the entire agreement. If there is any conflict, the signed Proposal/SOW prevails over these T&amp;C.</p>
